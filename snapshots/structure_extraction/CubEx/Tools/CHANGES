------- v 1.7 :

- changes in CubeFix, CubeSharp and other tools to handle properly the AO MUSE datacubes
  (that include large NaN gaps)

- minor tools (CubeArit, CubeReshape, etc.) improved, see usage screen.



-------- v 1.6 beta:

-- CubePSFSub:

   - major improvement of the algorithm with new options added. Optimized PSF subtraction layer by layer is
     acrivated with the option "-nbins -1" and setting zPSFsize. See usage screen for more info.

-- Cube2Im:

   - new options added, e.g. to filter out sky regions from broad-band images. See usage screen.

-- other tools:

   - minor bug fixing and improvements.


--------- v 1.5 beta:

-- CubeSharp:

   - added the option of not considering a given object in the sourcemask (e.g. a variable source
     like a quasar) in the continuum and line feature removal.

   - adjusted default behaviour when hsncube is provided (see CubeSharp usage screen).

   - minor bugs fixed

-- CubeFix:

   - added default option "writemap" to be used together with the new tool CubeAdd2Mask (see below).

-- New tool: CubeAdd2Mask:
   
   - add to a image mask the edge slices of selected ifu (stacks) given a cube and pixtable
     AND/OR add to the mask an object from a Objects_Id CubEx output. This tool may be run
     interactively with ds9 and it can improve data reduction for problematic datacubes
     where illumination correction fails miserably. See usage screen.

-- Cube2Im and CubeSel:

   - added the option of cutting individual subcubes and NB images around individual objects
     with spatial/wavelength padding and other features for data analysis (see CubSel and Cube2Im
     usage screens and the file README_ANALYSIS_EXAMPLE in the Sripts folder).

-- added README_ANALYSYS_EXAMPLE in the new folder Scripts with practical usage examples.


--------- v 1.4 beta:

-- CubeFix & CubeSharp:

   - added the option for the user to input a sourcemask. The sourcemask can be produced from 
     a white-light image of a higher-SN combined cube processed with CubEx-1.4: the resulting 
     Object_Id file may be given as a input to CubeFix. This significantly improves flat fielding
     and sky-subtraction. 

   - added the option in CubeSharp for the user to input a higher SN cube (e.g. from a previous iteration)
     for source continuum removal. This greatly improves sky-subtraction of bright sources. 
     Also, three parameters have been added for line feature checks. If a line is detected, 
     no shifting is performed in CubeSharp (only 0th-order sky-subtraction) to avoid affecting
     the line shape of bright sources (type CubeSharp for more information).

   - fixed a bug in CubeSharp that may cause flux-losses at some line edges. 

   - improved handling of bright sources and various minor bugs fixed in current version
     of CubeFix and CubeSharp.
 
-- CubeCombine:

  - completely new version that improves memory management and overall speed during cube combination.
    Typical memory usage is now less than 1-2Gb independently of the number of cubes to combine
    (combination is performed layer by layer), speed is improved by one order of magnitude. 
    Number of threads is not restricted anymore to any particular value.   

-- general / other tools:

  - added options to output NaN instead of -999
  - other tools improved, some changes in the default parameters. Type executable names
    in terminal for more information.


--------- v 1.3 beta:

- new DATA REDUCTION tools: 
  1) CubeFix: Flat-fielding Instrument-space Correction Software 
  2) CubeSharp: SHift and Add sky Removal Procedure. 
     Individual documentation for these two tools will be made available separately.
     For general usage, type CubeFix or CubeSharp from terminal.
  3) CubeCombine: combine cubes using sigma clipped mean or median, including slice edge masking,
     and weighting. Variance is propagated or calculated from combination. 
     Type CubeCombine from terminal for more information.

- several other generic tools have been added, e.g. for cube statistics (CubeStat)
  or to perform simple arithmetics (CubeArit), or PSF subtraction (CubePSFSub). 
  See folder and/or type executable names in terminal for more information. 

- NB: all tools executables have been renamed without the ".x" at the end!

---------- v 1.2b:

- CubeSel now reads and propagates WCS information into the output subcube. 
  CRVAL3 (initial lambda value) is updated according to the zmin selection cut.

- added "pix2wcs" tool (in this folder) to convert pixel position to ra-dec given a WCS header

- added a new routine: Cube2Spc.x to produce and plot 1d spectra from datacubes and checkcubes.

- added a new routins: CubeBKGSub.x to remove residual background with median filtering (Oct, 21, 2014).

- NB: the names of some optional parameters has been simplified. Run, e.g. "Cube2Im.x", 
   without command line arguments to get more information.
