This folder contains several tools for data reduction or tools that can be used in combination with CubEx.

NB: all these tools work with whole datacubes or datacube section using CFITSIO extended syntax,
    e.g. Cube2Im DATACUBE_FINAL.fits[20:100,20:100,1:3000] 

---- DATA REDUCTION TOOLS:

CubeFix : calculates and applies a flat-fielding correction to individual datacubes using 
          narrow and broad bands images constructed from the datacube itself and from 
          the associated pixel-table. Variance propagation is included. 
          If a sourcemask is provided (e.g. generated from a higher-SN cube white-light
          image processed with CubEx), flat-fielding around bright sources is
          significantly improved.
          Type CubeFix for the full list of options.

CubeSharp: performs sky LSF correction and subtraction from individual datacubes using 
           a flux-conserving algorithm based on sub-pixels shifts of spectral pixels.
           Pixel flux is "shifted" across neighboring pixels until variance is minimized
           with respect to a reference sky (calculated from the datacube itself).
	   A sourcemask may be provided as in the case of CubeFix.
           Variance is propagated accordingly.
           Type CubeSharp for the full list of options.

CubeCombine: combines datacubes that have been registered on the same voxel grid 
             using sigma clipped mean or median, including slice edge masking 
             (produced by CubeFix) and (variance) weighting. A variance extension is produced
             by the propagated variance from individual datacubes or calculated from the
             average. Type CubeCombine for the full list of options.
             CubeCombine is parallel (OMP). Set variable: OMP_NUM_THREADS before running it!
             NB: from version 1.4 there is no restriction in the number of OMP_NUM_THREADS.

CubeAdd2Mask: adds ifu edges or selected objects to a mask previously created with CubeFix.
              See CubeAdd2Mask for full list of options.

---- DATA ANALYSIS tools:

CubeSel : performs cube selection given a wavelength range or around objects
          from a mask. Type CubeSel (once installed) for the full list of options.

Cube2Im : produces pseudo-NB, 2D spectra and "optimally extracted"
         images and 2D spectra of cube, subcubes, CheckCubes from CubEx or around selected 
         objects from a mask. Type Cube2Im (once installed) for the full list of options.

Cube2Spc : uses the CheckCubes output of CubEx to produce and plot "optimally extracted" 1d spectra.

CubeBKGSub : performs continuum subtraction using median filtering (BKG subtraction with this tool is
             not supported anymore. Please use CubeFix and CubeSharp to improve data reduction).
	     BKG/continuum subtraction is controlled by two parameters: the size of one single cell of the BKG cube ('bpsize')
	     in units of the original cube and the size of the filter for the median filtering 
             of the BKG cube ('bfrad' option). 
             Type CubeBKGSub (once installed) for the full list of options.
             To activate the parallel version of the code, you need to specify the number of
             CPUs you want to use with the environment variable "OMP_NUM_THREADS", e.g. "export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8"
	     NB: because BKG residuals are greatly reduced by CubeFix and CubeSharp, this software is 
                  generally not useful anymore for BKG subtraction and it should be used only for CONTINUUM 
                  SUBTRACTION setting the first two parameters of bpsize to '1 1' and to '0 0' for bprad.

CubePSFSub:  performs PSF subtraction from datacubes. Type CubePSFSub for the full list of options.

CubeStat:    returns statistical information from datacubes or datacube sections.

CubeArit:    performs simple arithmetical operation with datacubes. Type CubeArit for full list of options.


see LICENCE.

In addition, there are also some generic, simple tools:

pix2wcs.x : converts pixel positions to ra-dec given a WCS fits header 

For installation, see INSTALL in the root folder of CubEx.
