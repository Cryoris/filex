Installation steps:

1. requires the library CFITSIO (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html), typically installed as standard library somewhere in your machine.
   Type: "locate libcfitsio.a" in your terminal to find out exactly where it is.

2. update the following fields in the Makefile according to your compiler and the location of the CFITSIO libraries: 
   FC= "gfortran/ or intel fortran compiler" (ifort not longer supported from v1.6)
   CFITSIO_LIBPATH= "path to the CFITSIO library"
   BINDIR= "installation directory for the executable file"

3. optional: adjust the compiler flags in the Makefile if needed.

4. type make (you may need to do "make clean" first)

5. repeat the steps above in the folder "Tools" if you want to install the additional, separate tools CubeFix, CubeSharp, CubeCombine, CubeSel, Cube2Im, Cube2Spc, etc.

DONE!
