------- v 1.7 :

- included the option for rescaling variance using only a subregion in the cube (useful
  to avoid edges and other parts of the cube that will bias the rescaling variance factor
  too high).

- various changes in Tools to handle AO MUSE datacubes (that include a large NaN gap)


-------- v 1.6 beta:

--> NB: from this version the command name does not include the version anymore,
        i.e. "CubEx" instead of "CubEx-1.6".

- improved handling of variance: the (pipeline-propagated) variance cube can be now rescaled
  before extraction/detection layer-by-layer by an automatically computed factor that takes
  into account the estimated (spatial) variance in the cube itself (see CubEx-1.6 usage screen
  for more information).

- parameter file structure has been improved for easier visualization. MinNSpax parameter
  is now called MinNVox for clarity. For backward compatibility, MinNSpax is still a valid name.

- new parameter "IdCube" to perform photometry only using existing Objects_Id cube without
  performing extraction and detection (useful, for matched 3d-aperture photometry).

- minor changes in Tools. See Tools/CHANGES.




-------- v 1.5 beta:

- improved masking before extraction/detection: now CubEx can use an image (produced, e.g. 
   by a previous CubEx run on a white-light image) as a mask. Individual objects may be
   masked/unmasked given the provided mask. Also, there is now the possibility 
   of masking individual wavelength layers. All these features have been grouped in a
   new section called "Masking" in the parameter file. A problem with XYedge masking
   was also fixed.

- added WCS to all output including CheckCubes.

- added a new parameter "Objects_SNR_Floor" to improve visualization of SN cubes
  with VisIt (See CubEx usage screen).

- short aliases for most common parameters have been added for command line usage.

- several changes in Tools. See Tools/CHANGES.

-------- v 1.4 beta:

- added support for images: now CubEx can also run on a image fits. 

- if variance extension/file is not present, a layer by layer variance is
  computed from the cube/image (need to set -MultiExt .true. or MultiExt = .true. 
  the parameter file)

- added a new parameter "SN_Threshold_Conn" (run CubEx-1.4 for more info).

- major changes in Tools. See Tools/CHANGES.

---------- v 1.3 beta:

MINOR:

- improved handling of UNDEF values in extraction and photometry.

- new CheckCubeTypes added :
  a) "CubeF": smoothed cube
  b) "VarF" : smoothed variance 

- associate default names for CheckCubes depending on their Type.

BUGS FIXED:

- fixed a bug in the variance filtering in the z-direction (the wrong array was used because 
  of zombie-code-lines from previous version).

- fixed a compilation problem with gfortran and CFITSIO libraries.


------------ v 1.2 beta:

MAJOR:

- new routine for Deblending (Deblend.f90) added:  this routine performs deblending 
  using a progressive SN threshold with min, max and number of steps defined by 
  the user (Deblend_* parameters). Final ISO volume for each deblended object corresponds 
  to the lowest SN threshold (within selected range) at which the object may be split.
  Deblending is performed on a 2D mask defined by collapsing along the 
  z-direction the minimum volume occupied by the object in the datacube.

- new routine Associate.f90: associate objects in wavelength if their projected area
  overlaps (controlled by parameter "AssocFrac"). There is now a new field "Assoc ID"
  in the output that tells the ID of the largest (by size) associated object. 

- new routine MergeAssoc.f90: merge associated objects in wavelength (see above)
  and produce a "merged catalogue" if requested (option AssocCatalogue) containing
  merged photometrical and geometrical information.

- new CheckCubeTypes have been added: 
  a) "Objects_Id_Assoc": for associated objects this cube contains the Assoc Id 
  (rather than the object Id). This is useful to group objects, e.g. part of a faint 
  continuum or different lines, together for spectrum  extraction or any other 
  post-processing analysis. 
  b) "Residuals": this is simply the opposite of the "Object" mask. 

- if present, reads WCS info from datacube fits header, performs coordinate transformations 
  and add ra, dec, and lambda of detected objects in the final catalogue.  


MINOR: 


- new parameter "XYedge" to exclude all pixels close to the edge before extraction.
  Particularly useful for cubes with noisy edges.

- new parameters "lmin" and "lmax": they work like "zmin" and "zmax" but select the
  cube in wavelength units (i.e., CUNIT3) rather than in spectral pixels. Needs a file
  with WCS to work. NB: lmin and lmax DO NOT have precedence over zmin and zmax.

- improved handling of UNDEF and edge effects during filtering (at expenses of 
  computational speed).


BUGS FIXED:

- all checkcubes except ID ones had a shift of one pixel with respect to correct values
  because of the ghost-zones in the masks that are not present in checkcubes. 
  This is now FIXED and, e.g. SNR checkcubes, should report correct values everywhere 
  in the present version.
 
- fixed a problem with variable string array length when compiled with gfortran (Oct 21, 2014).
